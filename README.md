_Meyesl is a nonblocking port scanner, written to help me learn Ocaml_ üê™


## Using It

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jmsdnns/meyesl
$ cd meyesl 
$ make
$ meyesl 127.0.0.1
```

## How It Works

More elaborate usage looks like this

```shell
$ meyesl 127.0.0.1 -p 22,80,8000-8099,9999
```

### PORTS

The `-p` flag is for specifying which ports to scan. Ports can be expressed as:

* list of numbers: eyes <target> -p 22,80,1336
* range of numbers: eyes <target> -p 22-80
* mix of both: eyes <target> -p 22,80,8000-8099,443,8443,3000-3443

### TIMEOUT

The `-t` flag controls how long to wait on a connection that isn't opening before decided it's just not reachable.

The default timeout is 3 seconds.

### HELP

```shell 
$ meyesl --help
